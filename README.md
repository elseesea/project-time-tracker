# project-time-tracker

## Overview

This app is a Project-Task Time Tracker.
Users can use this browser-based tracker to track projects and associated tasks.
A task can have detailed description, and a project can have many tasks.
Users can also track the time spent on each task, by manually entering the start
and end times, or by clicking on a start / end button to use the automatic timer.
Users can modify details of the task description at any time.

Users can run reports on time spent on all tasks in a project or on all of the
user's tasks. Accounts receivables departments can use those reports to bill
clients for time spent on the tasks. 

## Features

**Maintain projects & tasks entries**: Users can create, update, delete & view projects
and tasks.

**Time entries**: Enter time spent on tasks.

**Report** on total time spent by user, by project, by month, or a combination thereof.

## Technologies

MySQL
Bootstrap
JavaScript to implement automatic timer, to postback to server (AJAX?) without a
